        <h1 >Future of GPS</h1>
        <div class="writeup">
          <p>Countries continue to build and make improvements to their GPS systems. Efforts worldwide are being made to increase accuracy and improve reliability and GPS capabilities.</p>

          <p>For example:</p>
          <ul class="lis">
            <li>GNSS receivers are expected to become smaller, more accurate and more efficient, and GNSS technology is set to penetrate even the most cost-sensitive GPS applications.</li>
            <li>Scientists and rescue workers are finding new ways to use GPS technology in natural disaster prevention and analysis in the event of an earthquake, volcanic eruption, sinkhole or avalanche. For the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers are looking at using cellphone location data to assist with contact tracing in order to slow down the spread of the virus.</li>
            <li>The launch of new <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/cool-tech/what-is-gps-3/">GPS III satellites</a> will refine GPS accuracy to 1-3 meters, improve navigation abilities, and longer-lasting components as early as 2023. By broadcasting on the L1C civilian signal for interoperability with other satellite systems.</li>
            <li>The next generation of GPS satellites will include better signal protection, decreased susceptibility to <a href="https://breakingdefense.com/2020/02/new-gps-sats-can-maneuver-and-resist-jamming/">signal jamming</a> and more maneuverability to cover dead zones.</li>
            <li>The National Aeronautics and Space Administrationâ€™s (NASA) <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/jpl/what-is-an-atomic-clock">Deep Space Atomic Clock</a> is set to use a powerful onboard GPS satellite to help provide better consistency in time for future astronauts embarking on deep space journeys.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The future of GPS tracking will likely be far more accurate and effective for both personal and business use.</p>
