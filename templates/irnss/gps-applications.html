        <h1 >Applications of GPS</h1>
        <div class="writeup">
          <p>Like the Internet, GPS is an essential element of the global information infrastructure. The free, open, and dependable nature of GPS has led to the
            development of hundreds of applications affecting every aspect of modern life. GPS technology is now in everything from cell phones and wristwatches
            to bulldozers, shipping containers, and ATM's.</p>

            <p>GPS boosts productivity across a wide swath of the economy, to include farming, construction, mining, surveying, package delivery, and logistical supply
              chain management. Major communications networks, banking systems, financial markets, and power grids depend heavily on GPS for precise time
              synchronization. Some wireless services cannot operate without it.</p>

              <p> GPS saves lives by preventing transportation accidents, aiding search and rescue efforts, and speeding the delivery of emergency services and disaster
              relief. GPS is vital to the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) that will enhance flight safety while increasing airspace capacity.
              GPS also advances scientific aims such as weather forecasting, earthquake monitoring, and environmental protection.</p>

              <p>GPS remains critical to U.S. national security, and its applications are integrated into virtually every facet of U.S. military operations.
              Nearly all new military assets -- from vehicles to munitions -- come equipped with GPS.</p>

            <p>Some More Examples of GPS Applications are:</p>
            <ol class="lis">
              <li><strong>Aviation: </strong>Aviators throughout the world use the Global Positioning System (GPS) to increase the safety and efficiency of flight.
                 With its accurate, continuous, and global capabilities, GPS offers seamless satellite navigation services that satisfy many of the requirements for
                 aviation users.</li>
              <li><strong>Environment: </strong>To sustain the Earth's environment while balancing human needs requires better decision making with more up-to-date
                information. Gathering accurate and timely information has been one of the greatest challenges facing both government and private organizations
                that must make these decisions. The Global Positioning System (GPS) helps to address that need.</li>
              <li><strong>Marine: </strong>GPS provides the fastest and most accurate method for mariners to navigate, measure speed, and determine location.
                 This enables increased levels of safety and efficiency for mariners worldwide.</li>
              <li><strong>Space: </strong>The Global Positioning System (GPS) is revolutionizing and revitalizing the way nations operate in space, from guidance systems
                 for crewed vehicles to the management, tracking, and control of communication satellite constellations, to monitoring the Earth from space. </li>
              <li><strong>Surveying & Mapping: </strong>When used by skilled professionals, GPS provides surveying and mapping data of the highest accuracy. GPS-based
                 data collection is much faster than conventional surveying and mapping techniques, reducing the amount of equipment and labor required. A single
                 surveyor can now accomplish in one day what once took an entire team weeks to do.</li>
              <li><strong>Timing: </strong>In addition to longitude, latitude, and altitude, the Global Positioning System (GPS) provides a critical fourth
                dimension â€“ time. Each GPS satellite contains multiple atomic clocks that contribute very precise time data to the GPS signals. GPS receivers decode
                 these signals, effectively synchronizing each receiver to the atomic clocks. This enables users to determine the time to within 100 billionths of a
                 second, without the cost of owning and operating atomic clocks.</li>
